VectorField
===========

Experiments with vector fields.

### Blanket

Particles are generated in an even grid over the entire screen with no starting velocity.

### Curtain

Particles are generated along the top of the screen with a downward velocity of 10.

### Planetary

Attractor particles are generated randomly.

### Stream

Twice per frame, a particle is randomly generated and updated until it leaves the bounds of the window.

### Tree

A large number of particles are generated in the circle in the middle of the window.
